# JMGWorkScape App Documentation 

## About our app
This app was created for the company **JMG Landscape**. The purpose of the app is to manage and store customers' house data. From the customers' houses data, our app creates a route for each day depending from a customer's house data if work needed to be done that day of the week. Once a job is completed for a house, our app offers a feature that can create invoives for a house and deliver it to our customers as a pdf format.
